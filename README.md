# REST APIs with Flask and Python

This repository contains code that is created in the Python rest-api course followed at https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/
The course repository is https://github.com/tecladocode/rest-api-sections

The code is divided in folders, one for each rest-api Case


## Api_noDB

The code in this section includes a Flask app which is an API that represents items. It also includes user authentication.

## Api_Sqlite

The code in this section extends the last section by adding persistent storage of Items to a SQLite database and user registration.

## Api_SqlAlchemy

The code in this section extends the previous section by replacing the manual integration with SQLite, with SQLAlchemy—an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)—which allows us to easily replace SQLite with something like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
