This repository contains code that is created in the Python rest-api course followed at https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/
The course repository is https://github.com/tecladocode/rest-api-sections

The code is divided in folders, one for each rest-api Case.

## Api_Sqlite

The code in this section extends the last section by adding persistent storage of Items to a SQLite database and user registration.
